## Immersive

### A brief history of the web

- History of the web in 5 minutes 
- View source, or why I ❤️ the open web
	- Share knowledge
	- Create tools and share them
	- Small & large companies have the same shot
	- Web always moving forward with community-created projects:
		- Frameworks (bootstrap, skeleton, foundation)
		- Preprocessors (LESS, SCSS, Jade)
		- Methodologies (SMACSS, BEM)
	
### Talking shop

- What is HTML?
	- What is it for?
	- What does it look like? (code, rendering)
	- Tags & properties
	- Briefly mention IDs & classes without explaining
	
- What is CSS?
	- Content separated from style
	- What does it look like? (code, rendering)
	- Selectors, statements (rules, rule sets and at-rules) and properties (Check out [CSS General class & nomenclature](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/syntax))
	- Cascading: what are overrides?
	- IDs vs. classes
	
- Scripting
	- Supports HTML/CSS
	- Extends page functionality & behavior
	- Shouldn't be used in place of good, valid HTML/CSS

### Responsive design

- Ask: who knows what it means?
- The mobile web and responsive design
- How small screens change
