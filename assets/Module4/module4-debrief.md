# Design for the web

## What we've learned so far (hopefully!)

---

### *Web Designers* just make websites.
### *Designers* deliver information.

---

# The **open web** enables world-wide collaboration. Your solution can make a difference.

---

# HTML is for content. CSS is for style.

---

## They should work together, but never perform each other's function.

---

## HTML should be semantic:

- Cleaner
- Accessible
- Device-agnostic
- Future-proof

---

# CSS should be minimal, modular and re-usable.

---

# Good developers KISS.

---

# Good developers DRY.

---

# Good developers refactor.

# When in doubt, [validate](http://validator.w3.org)

---

## There are great CSS methods out there. Try them!

---

# Use frameworks that potentialize your code. 
# Avoid bloat and crutches.

---

# A site can react to viewport size in many ways.

---

- Fixed
- Fluid
- Adaptive
- Responsive

---

# Code "mobile first."
# Design in the order you feel comfortable.

---

- Designing mobile first helps answer questions, but it's not obligatory
- Make sure it's addressed on production:
	- Start with the bare minumum – pure content.
	- Add features/style/eyecandy progressively

---

# Consider your audience
## Choose target browsers appropriately

# Real life: Design vs. Front-end
![Beep](http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/Roadrunner-Coyote-A.jpg)

---

## Always add, never block.

---

# Show interest in each other's fields, but respect expertise.
## Example: Surveyplanet

- Developer had created entire website without interface
- Showed interest in design and openness
- We discussed every user flow/interaction
- Result: Improved ideas, better results

---

# Communicate.
# Say "I don't know" – before it's too late.

---

## Example: TestFlight

- Complex application for developers
- Good idea: interaction designer learn from developers
- Bad idea: know-it-all front-end developer messed up code and created problems for others

---


## Focus on the user

- Designers too focused on their masterpiece vs. the user and the tech.
- Frond-end developers too focused on the tech vs. the user and product.

---

## Create conventions
- Naming conventions (files, directories, layers, etc)
- Standard meetings (not too many)

---

## MAKE GREAT STUFF!
