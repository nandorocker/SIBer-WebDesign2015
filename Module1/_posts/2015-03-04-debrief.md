# Second hour

## Quick CSS Recap

1. What does CSS stand for? What does the *cascading* part mean? Why is it a good thing?
2. What are the parts of the CSS code?
3. What are classes?
4. What are IDs? When do we need them?

## Some more CSS

### DRY: multiple statements at once

If two elements share one property (or a few), you can combine them on a statement using a **comma**.

Consider these two statements:
	
	h1 {						|	h2 {
		color: #550000;			|		color: #550000
		font-weight: bold;		|		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: 36px			|		font-size: 30px;
		line-height: 40px		|		line-height: 40px
	}							|	}

As you can see, they both share a couple values: `color`, `font-weight`,`line-height`. You can avoid repetition by combining them:


	// The stuff they both share
	
	h1, h2 {
		color: #550000;
		font-weight: bold;
		line-height: 40px;
	} 
	
	// The individual stuff
	h1 {
		font-size: 36px;
	}
	
	h2 {
		font-size: 30px;
	}

### CSS Pseudo-Classes

- Provide styles not for the elements, but for the various **states** of elements:
	- Take off underlines from **links**
	- Turn text bold on **hover**
	- Make background gray on click (**active**)
	- Change font color on a form on **focus**
- Colon (:) used to define pseudo-classes:

	a:link {
	 text-decoration: underline;
	}
	
	a:hover,


### Advanced Selectors

Targetting elements can get tricky. There's lots of techniques to deal with ensuring the exact one is selected.

#### Precise

#### Universal Selector

Select *every* element on a page. This one adds a border to everything on the page.

	* {
	  border: 1px solid #000000;
	}
